Should edit with Sublime Text, [Sublime Linter](http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html), and [SublimeLinter-eslint](https://github.com/roadhump/SublimeLinter-eslint). Getting these to work may require installing some packages globally with `npm install -g packageName`. If you run `npm run lint` and it fails, it should tell you which packages you're missing.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
